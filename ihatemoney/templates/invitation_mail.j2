%}Hi,

Someone using the email address {{ contact_email }} invited you to share your expenses for "{{ project_name }}".

It's as simple as saying what did you pay for, for whom, and how much did it cost you, we are caring about the rest.

You can log in using this link: {{ join_link }}.

Once logged-in, you can use the following link which is easier to remember: {{ short_link }}
If your cookie gets deleted or if you log out, you will need to log back in using the first link.

Enjoy,
See you :-)
