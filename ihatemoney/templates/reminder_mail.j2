Hi,

You have just (or someone else using your email address) created the project "{{ project_name }}" to share your expenses.

You can access it here: {{ project_link }} (the identifier is {{ project.id }}).
If you want to share this project with your friends, you can share the identifier and the shared password with them or send them invitations with the following link:
{{ invite_link) }}

Enjoy,
{% endtrans %}
